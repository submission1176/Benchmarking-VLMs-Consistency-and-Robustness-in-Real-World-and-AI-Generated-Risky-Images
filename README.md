# Benchmarking VLMs Consistency and Robustness in Real-World and AI-Generated Risky Images


## Abstract
The rapid advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have led to an exponential increase in visual media. However, the resulting proliferation of online visual content, encompassing both generated and real-world images, raises significant safety concerns particularly for the underage Internet users.To address this critical safety detection challenge, we investigate the efficacy of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as scalable content moderators for web ecosystems. We conduct a comprehensive robustness evaluation of four state-of-the-art VLMs. This evaluation comprises two key components. Visual style transformation tests the models’ capacity to maintain safety classification performance when the visual style of the images is transformed, and task reformulation provides a detailed analysis of VLM robustness in semantic understanding. Our findings reveal significant weaknesses and a lack of robustness in these leading VLMs across both visual and textual encodings. These results indicate that current safety detection mechanisms for visual
media require substantial improvement and highlight a critical area for future research and development in content moderation technology.
